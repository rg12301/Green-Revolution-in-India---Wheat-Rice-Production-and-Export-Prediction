# Green Revolution in India: Wheat-Rice production and export prediction

India tops rice, pulses, wheat and spices in the world production table. Although the **third major sector contributing to the Indian economy is agriculture** (and other related sectors), it accounts for only about *17%* of GDP but provides about *60%* of the total number of jobs available in India. India has distinct advantages of providing the country-wide cultivation of varied crops with the highest arable land area (*60.44%*) of *179.8* million hectares and varied agro-based climatic conditions.

India 's agricultural (primary) sector has a crucial role to play in politics, economics and society. In the Global South, an enormous technology transition took place in the 1960s that succeeded in increased agricultural production. The transition from centuries-old methods of cultivation to mechanization has not only changed the productivity of horticulture, but also the lives of millions of people and the community.

## Conclusion

In India, Green Revolution has helped in achieving self-sufficiency in food production. Trade of surplus yield has contributed to Indiaâ€™s Economy as well. This revolution has led to many other socioeconomic benefits.

Production of food grains in India is strongly correlated to the population. It is not correlated with area of production and rainfall, which means the increasing yield is because of technological advancements that took place decades back and spread wide across the country.

## Future Scope

Green revolution was introduced for wheat and rice (major food grains) in India.

- Did technological advancements and changes in this revolution transferred to Horticulture Crops and led to NHM (National Horticulture Mission)?
- Was Golden Revolution as impactful as Green Revolution?
